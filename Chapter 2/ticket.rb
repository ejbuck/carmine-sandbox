#ticket.rb

=begin 
The Twain ticket is a simple example, but it encompasses some
vital Ruby procedures and principles. The most important lesson is
that the knowledge necessary for the program to do anything useful
resides in the object. The ticket object has the knowledge; you tap
into that knowledge by asking the ticket for it, via method calls.
Nothing is more central to Ruby programming than this. Itâ€™s all about
asking objects to do things and tell you things.
